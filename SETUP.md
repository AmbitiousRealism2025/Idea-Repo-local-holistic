# Minimax-M2 Local Research Setup Guide

## Project: Vibe Coder Tool Gap Research - Multi-Methodology Analysis

This repository contains **TWO research methodologies** executed in parallel to provide comprehensive coverage of tool opportunities for vibe coders.

### Methodology A: Specialized Domain Analysis
Five sub-agents each focus on one specific domain with deep expertise:

1. **Learning Tools** - agent-1a-learning-tools.md (10 ranked ideas)
2. **Workflow Tools** - agent-2a-workflow-tools.md (10 ranked ideas)
3. **Quality Tools** - agent-3a-quality-tools.md (10 ranked ideas)
4. **Collaboration Tools** - agent-4a-collaboration-tools.md (10 ranked ideas)
5. **AI Productivity Tools** - agent-5a-ai-productivity-tools.md (10 ranked ideas)
6. **Synthesis** - orchestrator-synthesis-a.md (comparative analysis)

### Methodology B: Holistic Multi-Lens Analysis
Five agents research ALL domains through unique analytical lenses:

1. **Pain Point Lens** - agent-1b-pain-point-lens.md (5 validated ideas)
2. **Competitive Gap Lens** - agent-2b-competitive-gap-lens.md (5 validated ideas)
3. **Emerging Tech Lens** - agent-3b-emerging-tech-lens.md (5 validated ideas)
4. **Workflow Integration Lens** - agent-4b-workflow-integration-lens.md (5 validated ideas)
5. **Indie Hacker Lens** - agent-5b-indie-hacker-lens.md (5 validated ideas)
6. **Synthesis** - orchestrator-synthesis-b.md (buildability matrix)

## What This Project Does

This project uses parallel research approaches to:
1. **Validate findings across multiple methodologies** - Do both approaches find the same opportunities?
2. **Identify unique insights** - What does each methodology discover that the other misses?
3. **Generate comprehensive opportunity list** - 50+ validated tool ideas
4. **Provide execution roadmap** - Sequenced development strategy for solo founders

## Prerequisites

- Solo founder buildability assessed

✅ **Methodology B (Holistic)**: COMPLETED
- All 6 documents created
- 25 validated tool ideas generated (5 per lens)
- Cross-validation through multiple analytical lenses

📋 **Meta-Analysis**: CREATING NOW
- Comparing methodologies
- Consolidating best ideas
- Final recommendations

📊 Meta-Analysis (NEW)
  ├── meta-summary-comparison.md (Methodology comparison)
  └── consolidated-top-ideas.md (Best ideas across both variants)
```

## Research Validation Standards

Both methodologies use identical validation requirements:

✅ **Three-Source Validation**: Minimum 3 independent sources per idea
✅ **Competitive Analysis**: Existing tools and gaps identified
✅ **Solo Founder Assessment**: Complexity, timeline, maintenance burden
✅ **Evidence-Based**: All claims verifiable through sources
✅ **Execution-Focused**: Clear path to MVP for each idea

## Key Research Insights

### Specialized Approach (Domain Deep-Dive)
- **Strength**: Detailed analysis per domain, identifies niche opportunities
- **Output**: 10 ideas per domain (breadth)
- **Best For**: Finding specific solutions within known problem areas

### Holistic Approach (Cross-Domain Pattern Recognition)
- **Strength**: Identifies patterns across domains, validates through multiple lenses
- **Output**: 5 validated ideas per lens (depth)
- **Best For**: Finding systemic problems affecting entire developer journey

## Merged Worktrees

This repository contains worktrees from:
- `/Users/ambrealismwork/Desktop/Coding-Projects/Idea-Repo-local` (Specialized)
- `/Users/ambrealismwork/Desktop/Coding-Projects/Idea-Repo-local-holistic` (Holistic - current)

Both methodologies executed with **Minimax-M2** in **local environment** for comparison.

## Parallel Execution Context

This local research is **one of four total projects**:

1. **Idea-Repo-cloud** (Specialized, Claude Sonnet) - Cloud execution
2. **Idea-Repo-cloud-holistic** (Holistic, Claude Sonnet) - Cloud execution
3. **Idea-Repo-local** (Specialized, Minimax-M2) - Local execution
4. **Idea-Repo-local-holistic** (Holistic, Minimax-M2) - **← This repository**

**Total**: ~150 validated ideas across 4 variants with different methodologies and execution environments

## Next Steps After Research Completion

### 1. Review Results
- [ ] Compare Methodology A vs B findings
- [ ] Identify convergent opportunities (found by both)
- [ ] Note unique insights from each approach
- [ ] Assess research quality across both

### 2. Create Meta-Analysis
- [ ] Compare methodologies: which works better?
- [ ] Consolidate best ideas from both variants
- [ ] Create final top-20 recommendations
- [ ] Prioritize by solo founder viability

### 3. Git Operations
```bash
# All files already committed from holistic variant
# Merge from specialized variant now
git add .
git commit -m "Merge specialized variant (A) with holistic variant (B)"
git push origin master
```

## Validation Evidence

**Methodology A (Specialized)**:
- 50 ideas × 3+ sources = 150+ validation points
- Deep domain expertise per area
- Focused on specific tool categories

**Methodology B (Holistic)**:
- 25 ideas × 3+ sources = 75+ validation points
- Cross-domain pattern recognition
- Multiple lens validation per idea

**Combined**:
- 225+ total validation points
- Multiple validation approaches
- Highest confidence in convergent findings

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Can't find specific agent files
- **Solution**: Check both agent-1a/1b through agent-5a/5b naming

**Issue**: Ideas overlap between methodologies
- **Expected**: Some convergence is good! Indicates real market opportunities

**Issue**: Want to compare cloud vs local results
- **Solution**: Sync with cloud worktrees when available
