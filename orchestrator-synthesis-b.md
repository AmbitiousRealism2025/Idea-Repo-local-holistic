## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

**WebGPU Adoption Risk**: Browser support incomplete (Safari, Firefox lag)
- **Mitigation**: Chrome-only MVP, progressive enhancement for other browsers
- **Timeline Impact**: +2-3 months if waiting for full support

**AI API Rate Limits**: Free tiers insufficient, paid tiers expensive
- **Mitigation**: Focus on local AI (CodeGuard), usage-based pricing for others
- **Timeline Impact**: Minimal if using WebLLM approach

**Figma API Changes**: Platform APIs evolve, breaking changes possible
- **Mitigation**: Abstract API layer, version pinning, rapid update process
- **Timeline Impact**: +1-2 weeks per major change

### Market Risks

**Competition from Big Tech**: Microsoft/Google could build similar features
- **Mitigation**: Focus on solo founder needs, faster iteration, better UX
- **Probability**: Medium - but big tech focuses on enterprise, not individual devs

**AI Tool Market Saturation**: Too many AI assistants, differentiation difficult
- **Mitigation**: Focus on privacy/local-first angle, specific workflows
- **Probability**: Medium - but local AI is differentiator

**Economic Downturn**: Developers reduce tool spending
- **Mitigation**: Freemium models, clear ROI demonstrations
- **Probability**: Low-Medium - developer tools relatively recession-proof

### Solo Founder Sustainability Risks

**Maintenance Burden**: 5+ tools = too much context switching
- **Mitigation**: Build in phases, sunset underperforming tools, automate updates
- **Probability**: High - requires discipline

**Burnout Risk**: Building multiple complex products simultaneously
- **Mitigation**: Start with 1-2 tools, prove traction before expanding
- **Probability**: Medium - mitigated by sequencing strategy

**Feature Creep**: Adding features instead of shipping
- **Mitigation**: Strict MVP scopes, customer feedback-driven development
- **Probability**: Medium - common founder mistake

---
