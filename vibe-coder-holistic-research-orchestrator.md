# Vibe Coder Tool Gap Research - Holistic Validation Approach

## Mission
Orchestrate validated, execution-ready research into vibe coder tool gaps by coordinating five independent holistic researchers. Each agent will research across ALL domains from a unique analytical lens, with mandatory validation requirements to ensure market-ready opportunities.

## Target Audience Definition: Vibe Coders
Developers who:
- Started with no-code tools or had minimal/no formal programming training
- Have engaged with coding over time and are actively improving their skills
- Are on a path toward legitimate, marketplace-viable full-stack development
- Often use AI-assisted coding tools and prioritize rapid iteration
- Value practical learning through building over traditional education paths

## Research Objectives
1. **Current State Analysis**: Identify gaps in today's available tools (2025)
2. **Future Gap Identification**: Spot emerging trends and near-future needs (6-12 months)
3. **Cross-Domain Opportunities**: Find tools that bridge multiple problem spaces
4. **Validated Opportunities**: Prove market need through multi-source validation
5. **Execution Planning**: Assess buildability for solo founder development

## Strategic Constraints

### Solo Founder Constraint
All ideas MUST be:
- Maintainable by a single developer
- Scoped for realistic ongoing development by one person
- Not dependent on large teams, complex infrastructure, or extensive support operations
- Achievable with TypeScript/React/Convex stack or reasonable extensions

This constraint forces practical scoping and filters for actually buildable tools.

## Orchestration Strategy

### Phase 1: Deploy Five Holistic Research Agents with Distinct Lenses

Create five parallel research agents. Each agent researches **ALL domains** (learning, workflow, quality, collaboration, AI tools) but through a **unique analytical lens**:

#### Agent 1: User Pain Point Lens
**Research Approach**: Start from vibe coder frustrations and complaints
**Primary Sources**: Reddit (r/learnprogramming, r/webdev, r/reactjs), Discord communities, Twitter/X, dev.to comments, forum discussions
**Driving Questions**:
- What are vibe coders actively complaining about RIGHT NOW?
- What friction points cause them to abandon projects or tools?
- What do they say they "wish existed" in discussions?
- Where do they express confusion, overwhelm, or frustration with current tools?

**Validation Requirement**: Each idea must cite 3+ distinct user pain points from community discussions

---

#### Agent 2: Competitive Gap Lens
**Research Approach**: Analyze what existing popular tools DON'T do well
**Primary Sources**: Product Hunt, AlternativeTo, GitHub issues/discussions, tool review sites, comparison articles
**Driving Questions**:
- What features do users request but tools haven't implemented?
- What do existing tools over-complicate or under-deliver?
- Where are there 4-star tools that could be 5-star with specific improvements?
- What workflows require duct-taping multiple tools together?

**Validation Requirement**: Each idea must identify 3+ existing tools and their specific shortcomings

---

#### Agent 3: Emerging Technology Lens
**Research Approach**: Focus on cutting-edge capabilities becoming accessible
**Primary Sources**: Technical blogs, WebGPU/WebAssembly docs, local AI developments, browser API updates, framework evolution
**Driving Questions**:
- What new technical capabilities enable tools that weren't possible 12 months ago?
- How could local AI models (running in-browser or on-device) transform vibe coder workflows?
- What browser APIs or framework features are underutilized for dev tools?
- Where can emerging tech reduce complexity for non-experts?

**Validation Requirement**: Each idea must demonstrate technical feasibility with current/near-future tech

---

#### Agent 4: Workflow Integration Lens
**Research Approach**: Look for tools that connect disparate parts of the development process
**Primary Sources**: Developer workflow studies, productivity tool ecosystems, integration platforms, workflow automation discussions
**Driving Questions**:
- What parts of the dev workflow are currently disconnected and manual?
- Where do vibe coders lose context switching between tools?
- What "glue work" could be automated or streamlined?
- Which tool combinations are commonly used together but poorly integrated?

**Validation Requirement**: Each idea must map the workflow gap between 2+ existing tools/processes

---

#### Agent 5: Indie Hacker Lens
**Research Approach**: Focus on tools indie builders wish existed for their own work
**Primary Sources**: Indie Hackers, Hacker News "Show HN", maker communities, build-in-public threads, bootstrapper forums
**Driving Questions**:
- What tools do successful indie hackers build for themselves but never productize?
- What do solo founders say slows them down in their build process?
- Where do indie builders compromise on quality due to time constraints?
- What would help indie hackers ship faster without sacrificing learning?

**Validation Requirement**: Each idea must reference indie hacker workflows or stated needs

---

### Phase 2: Mandatory Validation Protocol

Every idea from every agent MUST include:

1. **Three-Source Validation**:
   - Minimum 3 independent sources confirming the need/gap
   - Sources must be recent (within 12 months unless addressing persistent pain point)
   - At least one source must be direct user voice (not analysis/opinion pieces)

2. **Competitive Landscape Check**:
   - List existing tools in this space (can be "none found" if genuinely novel)
   - Explain why existing solutions fall short OR why no solution exists yet
   - Identify differentiation opportunity

3. **Solo Founder Buildability Assessment**:
   - Estimate build complexity: Low (1-2 weeks MVP) | Medium (1-2 months MVP) | High (3+ months MVP)
   - Identify technical risks or unknowns
   - Note ongoing maintenance burden: Light | Medium | Heavy
   - Assess if sustainable for one person to maintain

### Phase 3: Output Format Per Agent

Each agent delivers **5 ranked ideas** (1 = highest viability for solo founder execution):

```markdown
## Idea #[Rank]: [App Name]

### Description
[2-4 sentences explaining what this tool does and why it matters]

### Gap Addressed
[Specific problem this solves that current tools don't]

```

### Phase 4: Orchestrator Synthesis

After all five agents complete research, create comprehensive analysis documents:

#### Document 1-5: Individual Agent Reports
Create separate markdown files:
- `agent-1-pain-point-lens.md`
- `agent-2-competitive-gap-lens.md`
- `agent-3-emerging-tech-lens.md`

    - Solo founder sustainability concerns

## Research Methodology Guidelines

### Deep Research Requirements
- Spend significant time per domain exploring multiple sources
- Don't just surface-level scan; read discussions, issues, pain points thoroughly
- Look for patterns across multiple communities/sources
- Investigate both current state (2025) and emerging trends

### Source Quality Standards
- Prioritize primary sources (user voices) over secondary analysis
- Recent sources preferred (last 12 months) unless addressing persistent issues
- Diverse source types: forums, GitHub, Product Hunt, technical blogs, community discussions
- Avoid single-source conclusions; validate across multiple channels

### Validation Rigor
- Be skeptical: "Is this really a gap or just one loud voice?"
- Check if proposed solution already exists and we just didn't find it
- Assess if the pain point is actually widespread or niche
- Verify technical feasibility before including idea

### Creative Constraint Balance
- Solo founder constraint should guide scoping, not kill creativity
- Think "elegant simplicity" not "feature-poor"
- MVP mindset: what's the smallest version that delivers core value?
- Consider: simple tools can have profound impact

## Success Criteria

- **25 validated ideas** (5 per agent) with comprehensive evidence
- **75+ unique sources** cited across all validation (3 per idea minimum)
- **Deep cross-domain research** evidencing holistic understanding
- **Ranked by execution viability** with clear buildability assessments
- **Convergence insights** showing market validation through independent discovery
- **Actionable roadmap** providing sequenced development strategy for solo founder

## Execution Instructions

1. **Launch Phase**: Deploy all five holistic research agents in parallel using Task tool
2. **Agent Configuration**: Use `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` with deep research capability
3. **Research Execution**: Agents use web search, web fetch, and any research tools available
4. **Validation Phase**: Each agent applies mandatory three-source validation to every idea
5. **Synthesis Phase**: Orchestrator creates buildability matrix and execution roadmap
6. **Output Generation**: Save all 6 documents (5 agent reports + 1 synthesis) to working directory
